00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.940
9.7 chunks on an eight vikkstar’s open

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.000
He's on, take it away Vik!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.029
It's déjà vu—is it déjà Vik? Can he score, can he pass? 
It goes to Harry! [Applause]

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.920
It's about time, he's deserved the goal 
in one of these games—and he's got one.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.039
Harry Wroetoshaw with the seventh of the match.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.619
He pictured his mother's face in the top corner—and he nailed it.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.739
What a finish, what a strike! Anyone that plays with Harry 
knows he has a cannon of a strike on him.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.840
He doesn’t often get to unleash it in these matches—but look at this!

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.420
And let's talk about his assist for Vikkstar—assist vision! 
I mean he's a playmaker these days.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.160
He's adapted to this game as he's got older—this is it.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.280
I'll tell you what, a fantastic goal! It's 7–4 now, 
and you said it—the Sidemen are known to get seven.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.539
The technique on display there from Harry is nothing short 
of Kevin De Bruyne. Nothing QC could have done about it.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.860
Billy Wingrove loving life once again—
he's managed to get his team to seven goals.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.320
Maybe more still to come…

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.520
Yeah, and there’s nothing he could have done about that.
